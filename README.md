# Bike_Sharing_Analysis

## Overview
Kate tells us that an angel investor is interested in providing seed funding for our bike sharing program. To gain a better understanding of how the program will work in our hometown, we have created several data visuals that will show us how the program is being used. 

## Results

### Who is Using the Program?
First, we wanted to get a better understanding of who is using the bike sharing program in New York. We first created a pie chart to show the percentage of users who are subscribed to the bike sharing program on a yearly basis and those who only use the program as a one-time customer. We can see that a large sum of the bike sharing users are subsribed to the program on a yearly basis.

We also created a second pie chart that shows us the differences in usage by gender. The data shows the program is used more often by men than women or people with unknown gender identities.

### When do Riders Use the Program?
Our team then created a heat map to show the different times and days that the program is used throughout the week. We can see that the bikes are used most frequently between 6-9am and 4-7pm on the weekdays and between 10am and 7pm on the weekend.

We then created another heatmap that shows a comparison of the trips throughout the week by gender. The data shows that all genders follow a similar usage pattern throughout the week.

Our third heatmap shows a cross in usage between usertype and gender. We can see that men and women who are subscribed to the program tend to use the bikes more frequently on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.

### How Long are Bikes Used?
Our team then created a few line charts to show how long the bikes are being used for. The first line chart shows the total check out time for all users. From this chart, we can see that most rides last for 20 minutes or less.

Finally, we created a second line chart to determine whether or not there are any differences in the length of trips by gender. From this chart, we can see that a majority of each gender identity completes their trips in 20 minutes or less.

## Summary
From our data anaylsis we have identified that men and people who are subscribed for a yearly membership are more likely to use the program on a more frequent basis. Knowing this allows us to focus on a target audience to create a stronger group of people who use the program more frequently. If we want to ensure long-term success for our company, we can focus on enrolling more people to the annual subscription and do more efforts to enroll more women.

When taking into account the time that bikes are used and the average duration of each trip, we can infer that a large group of people are probably using the bike program to travel to and from work. This information can help us determine where we might want to put the bike racks and major bike routes. Having the racks located in high traffic areas will likely cause more people to use them.

To deepen our analysis, we can create an additional chart that shows a comparison of bike usage between different age groups. We can also create a map that will show the location of the where bikes are checked out the most to display any hot spots within the city.
